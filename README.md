# Deep_learning_disease_detection

Julia example of combining CNN with Ant Colony Optimization.

## Week 7 submission
The CNN follows `Conv \u2192 ReLU \u2192 MaxPool \u2192 Dense` using Flux.jl.
ACO is currently a placeholder for hyperparameter tuning.
This simple setup shows how ACO can refine training without Python.
Models save to `models/` and plots to `output/`.
